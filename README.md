# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game that runs in the terminal or command prompt. 

## Compatibility

- **Tested Platform:** Windows
- **Recommended OS:** Windows 11
  - Note: The default command prompt in Windows 10 may not support the required Unicode characters.
- **Libraries Used:** random, math, time, keyboard, msvcrt

## Running the Game

- **Executable File:** There is an executable file (`snake.exe`) provided for convenience. However, Windows Defender might flag it as "Unknown", causing issues during download or execution.
- **Running via Python:** Alternatively, you can run the game by executing `snake.py` along with other Python files. Ensure that the Python environment is set up correctly.
  - Note: Make sure the terminal window is large enough to display the entire game board. Otherwise, it may throw an error.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the movement of the snake.
- Press `ESC` to exit the game.
